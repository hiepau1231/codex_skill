| `{CLAUDE_ANALYSIS_FORMAT}` | Copy entire fenced code block from `references/claude-analysis-template.md` | Yes (Claude analysis only) | — |

### Last-mode additional placeholders

| Placeholder | Source | Required | Default |
|-------------|--------|----------|---------|
| `{COMMIT_LIST}` | Formatted list: `<SHA> <subject>` per commit | Yes (last mode) | — |

### Round 2+ additional placeholders

| Placeholder | Source | Required | Default |
|-------------|--------|----------|---------|
| `{AGREED_POINTS}` | Findings both Claude and Codex agree on (merged descriptions) | Yes | — |
| `{DISAGREED_POINTS}` | Findings where Claude and Codex disagree (both positions) | Yes | — |

### SESSION_CONTEXT Schema

When user provides context or Claude can infer it, format as:

```
Constraints: {e.g. "team uses 72-char subject line limit"}
Assumptions: {e.g. "this is a squash commit covering multiple changes"}
Tech stack: {languages, frameworks}
Acceptance criteria: {what defines a good commit message for this project}
Review scope: {draft | last N commits}
Project conventions: {PROJECT_CONVENTIONS}
```

## Draft Review Prompt (Round 1)
```
## Your Role
You are Codex acting as an equal peer reviewer of commit messages. Another reviewer (Claude) is independently analyzing the same commits — you will debate afterward.

## Task
{USER_REQUEST}

## Session Context
{SESSION_CONTEXT}

## Commit Message to Review
{COMMIT_MESSAGES}

## How to Inspect Changes
Run `{DIFF_CONTEXT}` to read the staged diff. Verify the message accurately describes the changes.

## Project Conventions
{PROJECT_CONVENTIONS}

## Instructions
1. Focus on message quality only — do NOT review code correctness.
2. Read the staged diff to verify message accuracy and scope.
3. Check: clarity, convention compliance, scope accuracy, structure.
4. Verify message claims match the actual diff.
5. Focus on identifying problems and their impact — do NOT suggest fixes.
6. Use EXACT output format below.

## Required Output Format
{OUTPUT_FORMAT}

## Last Review Prompt (Round 1)
```
## Your Role
You are Codex acting as an equal peer reviewer of commit messages. Another reviewer (Claude) is independently analyzing the same commits — you will debate afterward.

## Task
{USER_REQUEST}

## Session Context
{SESSION_CONTEXT}

## Commits to Review
{COMMIT_LIST}

## Commit Messages
{COMMIT_MESSAGES}

## How to Inspect Changes
- For each commit, run `git show <SHA>` to see its individual diff.
- Also run `{DIFF_CONTEXT}` for aggregate diff context.
- Verify each message accurately describes its commit's changes.

## Project Conventions
{PROJECT_CONVENTIONS}

## Instructions
1. Focus on message quality only — do NOT review code correctness.
2. Inspect EACH commit's diff individually — do not rely on aggregate diff alone.
3. Check: clarity, convention compliance, scope accuracy, structure.
4. Verify each message's claims match its actual diff.
5. In Evidence field, always reference the specific commit SHA and subject.
6. Focus on identifying problems and their impact — do NOT suggest fixes.
7. Use EXACT output format below.

## Required Output Format
{OUTPUT_FORMAT}
```

## Claude Independent Analysis Prompt — Draft mode
```
## Your Task
You are reviewing commit message(s) independently. Codex is reviewing the same commits separately — you will NOT see their findings until later.

## INFORMATION BARRIER
- Do NOT read $STATE_DIR/review.md or any Codex output.
- Form your OWN conclusions based on the diff and message text.
- Commit to specific positions.

## Commit Message to Review
